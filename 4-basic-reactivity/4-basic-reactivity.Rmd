## Intro

The key idea of **reactive programming** is to specify a graph of dependencies so that when an input changes, all related outputs are automatically updated.

When the `server()` function is called, Shiny creates a new local environment that is independent of every other invocation of the function. This allows each session to have a unique state, as well as isolating the variables created inside the function. 

## Input

The `input` argument is list-like, but read-only. It reflects what is happening in the browser, which is considered the source of truth for the app. 

To read from an `input`, you must be in a reactive context created by a function like `render*()` or `reactive()`.

## Output

The `output` argument is also list-like. 

It's ID is quoted in the UI, but not in the server. 

The `render` function does two things:

1. Sets up special reactive context to track what input the output uses. i.e. **you don’t need to tell an output when to update, because Shiny automatically figures it out for you.**

2. Converts R to HTML

## Declarative programming

Think of your app as providing Shiny with recipes, not giving it commands.

Because code is only run when needed, you need to look at the **reactive graph** to understand the order of execution. 

Below is a reactive graph for the sample server section:

```{r react1, eval=FALSE}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  text <- reactive(paste0("Hello ", input$name, "!"))
  output$greeting <- renderText(text())
}
```

### Practice

**1. Draw the reactive graph for the following server functions:**

```{r react2, eval=FALSE}
server1 <- function(input, output, session) {
  c <- reactive(input$a + input$b)
  e <- reactive(c() + input$d)
  output$f <- renderText(e())
}
```

a + b -> c + d -> e -> f

```{r react3, eval=FALSE}
server2 <- function(input, output, session) {
  x <- reactive(input$x1 + input$x2 + input$x3)
  y <- reactive(input$y1 + input$y2)
  output$z <- renderText(x() / y())
}
```

x -> y -> z

```{r react4, eval=FALSE}
server3 <- function(input, output, session) {
  d <- reactive(c() ^ input$d)
  a <- reactive(input$a * 10)
  c <- reactive(b() / input$c) 
  b <- reactive(a() + input$b)
}
```

a -> b -> c -> d 

**2. Can the reactive graph contain a cycle? Why/why not?**

A reactive graph essentially is a cycle that is updated every time the input is changed. For each session, each combination of inputs can only create one final product in the browser. 

## Reactive Expressions

![](producers-consumers.png)

When assembling an app, it is a best practice to ensure that the functions outside of the app focus on the computation so that the code inside of the app can focus on responding to user actions.

Outputs are atomic: they’re either executed or not as a whole.

To create a reactive expression, we call `reactive()` and assign the results to a variable. To later use the expression, we call the variable like it’s a function.

Modules allow you to extract out repeated code for reuse, while guaranteeing that it’s isolated from everything else in the app.

### Practice 

**1. Use reactive expressions to reduce the duplicated code in the following simple apps.**

#TODO: finish problems once they've been added

## Controlling Timing

`reactiveTimer()` is a reactive expression that has a dependency on a hidden input: the current time.

An `actionButton()` helps with expensive click computations. 

`eventReactive()` makes it possible to separate the dependencies from the values used to compute the result.

### Observers

There are two important differences between `observeEvent()` and `eventReactive()`:

- You don’t assign the result of `observeEvent()` to a variable, so
- You can’t refer to it from other reactive consumers.

Observers and outputs are closely related. You can think of outputs as having a special side-effect: updating the HTML in the user’s browser.
